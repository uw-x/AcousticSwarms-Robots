## Hardware
The hardware design for the robots used in the acoustic swarms, including the circuits and PCB files.

## Firmware
This subfolder contains the source code for the firmware we upload on the robots. The firmware is compiled and uploaded using [Segger Embedded Studio v7.22](https://www.segger.com/downloads/embedded-studio/) and the [nRF5 SDK v17.0.1](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF5-SDK/Download#infotabs). 

## Receiver
